      <h2>🌱 Introduction</h2>
      <p>Authentication is more than a technical step—it's the foundation of trust in any digital platform. Whether you're building internal APIs or integrating third-party services, choosing the right strategy matters. In this post, I’ll share how I’ve used JWT and OAuth2 in real-world projects and when each shines.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>🔐 What is JWT?</h2>
      <p>JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, stateless token format used to verify users. It encodes claims in JSON and is signed using a secret or key pair. Once issued, the server doesn’t need to store session data—making JWT ideal for scalable, high-performance APIs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔑 What is OAuth2?</h2>
      <p>OAuth2 is a protocol for delegated access. It allows users to grant limited permissions to third-party apps without sharing credentials. Widely used in “Sign in with Google” scenarios, OAuth2 uses access tokens, refresh tokens, and scopes to manage secure access.</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Type</td>
          <td>Token format</td>
          <td>Protocol</td>

          <td>Security</td>
          <td>Signed token</td>
          <td>Token + scopes + refresh flow</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Server Storage</td>
          <td>Stateless</td>
          <td>May require token management</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>🛠️ My Experience</h2>
      <p>In my Secure Wellness Platform, I used JWT to enable fast, stateless authentication. It simplified deployment on AWS and improved response times. For enterprise connectors, OAuth2 was essential—especially when integrating with Microsoft Graph and Google APIs. It gave me granular control over permissions and ensured compliance with enterprise standards.</p>

      <h2>🌟 Conclusion</h2>
      <p>JWT and OAuth2 aren’t rivals—they’re tools for different needs. JWT is lightweight and fast, perfect for internal systems. OAuth2 offers depth and control, ideal for external integrations. As a full-stack developer, I choose based on context, always aiming for secure and seamless user experiences.</p>
