      <h2>🌱 Introduction</h2>
      <p>Authentication isn’t just a technical step—it’s the foundation of trust in any digital product. Whether you're building internal APIs or integrating third-party services, choosing the right authentication strategy can shape your platform’s security, scalability, and user experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔐 What is JWT?</h2>
      <p><strong>JWT (JSON Web Token)</strong> is a compact, stateless token format used to verify users. It encodes claims in JSON and is signed using a secret or key pair. Once issued, the server doesn’t need to store session data—making JWT ideal for scalable, high-performance APIs.</p>
      <p><em>Best for:</em> Internal APIs, microservices, stateless authentication.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>🔑 What is OAuth2?</h2>
      <p><strong>OAuth2</strong> is a protocol for delegated access. It allows users to grant limited permissions to third-party apps without sharing credentials. Commonly used in “Sign in with Google” flows, OAuth2 uses access tokens, refresh tokens, and scopes to manage secure access.</p>
      <p><em>Best for:</em> Third-party integrations, enterprise-grade access control.</p>

      <h2>🛠️ My Experience</h2>
      <p>In my <strong>Secure Wellness Platform</strong>, I used JWT for fast, stateless authentication. It simplified deployment on AWS and improved response times by 40%.</p>
      <p>For <strong>enterprise connectors</strong>, OAuth2 was essential—especially when integrating with Microsoft Graph and Google APIs. It gave me granular control over permissions and ensured compliance with enterprise standards.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>🌟 Conclusion</h2>
      <p>JWT and OAuth2 aren’t competitors—they’re tools for different needs. Use JWT for lightweight, stateless authentication. Use OAuth2 when you need delegated access and fine-grained control. As a full-stack developer, I choose based on context—always aiming for secure, scalable, and seamless user experiences.</p>
