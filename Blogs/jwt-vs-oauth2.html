    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>When building secure platforms, authentication is the first line of defense. Two popular approaches—JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2—offer distinct advantages depending on your use case. In this post, I’ll break down their differences and share how I’ve used each in real-world projects.</p>

    <h2>What is JWT?</h2>
    <p>JWT is a compact, URL-safe token format used for stateless authentication. It contains claims encoded in JSON and signed with a secret or public/private key pair. Once issued, the server doesn’t need to store session data—making JWT ideal for scalable APIs.</p>

    <h2>What is OAuth2?</h2>
    <p>OAuth2 is a protocol that allows third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials. It’s widely used for delegated access—think “Login with Google.” OAuth2 involves access tokens, refresh tokens, and scopes to control permissions.</p>

    <h2>Key Differences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>JWT:</strong> Simple, fast, stateless. Best for internal APIs and microservices.</li>
      <li><strong>OAuth2:</strong> More secure, supports token revocation and scopes. Ideal for third-party integrations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>In my Secure Wellness Platform, I implemented JWT for user authentication. It allowed seamless login and fast API responses without server-side session storage. For enterprise connectors, I used OAuth2 to integrate with Microsoft Graph and Google APIs—ensuring secure, permission-based access.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing between JWT and OAuth2 depends on your platform’s needs. JWT is great for speed and simplicity, while OAuth2 offers robust security for external integrations. As a full-stack developer, I tailor auth strategies to match the project’s scale and sensitivity.</p>
