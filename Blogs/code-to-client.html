      <h2>🌟 Introduction</h2>
      <p>After years of building secure platforms and enterprise connectors, I realized something: I wanted more ownership, more flexibility, and more direct impact. That’s when I stepped into freelance development—not just as a coder, but as a problem solver for businesses that value quality and trust.</p>

      <h2>🧠 My Background</h2>
      <p>I’ve spent 4+ years working with technologies like ReactJS, Spring Boot, and AWS. From wellness platforms to enterprise integrations, I’ve built systems that are secure, scalable, and user-friendly. Now, I bring that same precision to freelance projects.</p>
